# WeatherData
 Here, I will be trying out a project where I compile previous weather data to see its predictive potential - if it fails, then at the very least, this project may be used to show the limits of using data to make decisions.

 The Approach:
 1) Find weather datasets. 
 2) Use Python in Jupyter Notebooks to generate a regression analysis.
 3) See if the predictive model is useful at all for predicting the day-to-day weather. Usefulness will be dictated by how close the predicted temperature is to the temperatures forecasted for the week.

 Python code will be placed on GitHub.
